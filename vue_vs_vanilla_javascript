When comparing the Vue version of the Student Club Roster to the Vanilla JavaScript(VJ) version,
the first big difference I notice is that with Vue, you need a lot less variables. With VJ, you have
to create a lot of variables to access all the HTML elements and work with them by using document.querySelector().
With Vue, you use the same variable names in the HTML template as you do in the JavaScript.

Another difference is that you don't need event listeners with Vue like you need with VJ. You can use v-on directives
to call a function when something is clicked or there is input provided.

Another difference is that with Vue, you don't need to change the inner HTML of elements. You instead change the values
in the script and the page reacts automatically to reflect the changes when you use the v-model directive.

Another difference is that you can use a computed function to calculate and automatically change something based on data
and that data changing. In VJ, you have to make sure you're always updating the value of something with changes, meaning
you have to write the same line of code in multiple event handlers and functions with VS.

After getting a better understanding of Vue, I think I prefer using Vue over VJ. It seemed intimidating at first, but
I now think it's more simple than Vanilla JavaScript and allows for less code because it uses data binding and reacts
immediately to changes in the webpage. It's kind of like Vue makes HTML and the script become fast friends. With
Vanilla JavaScript, you have to tell the script a lot more about the HTML before they can work together and be friends.
